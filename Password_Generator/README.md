# Password Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates random passwords based on user input. The user can specify how many passwords they want to generate and the desired length of each password. The generator supports letters (both lowercase and uppercase), numbers, and special characters.

## Features
- Generates multiple random passwords.
- Allows the user to specify the number of passwords and the password length.
- Supports lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- Validates user input to ensure the number of passwords and password length are positive integers.

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to input the number of passwords they want to generate.
2. The user is also asked to input the desired length of each password.
3. The script generates the requested number of passwords, each with the specified length, using a random selection of characters.
4. The program ensures valid input by asking the user to re-enter their input if it's invalid.

## Example Usage
