# Guessing Game

This is a fun number guessing game built with Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The player must guess a randomly chosen number within a specific range, based on the selected difficulty level. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. 

## Features
- Choose between three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- Easy: Guess a number between 1-10 with 6 attempts.
- Medium: Guess a number between 1-60 with 4 attempts.
- Hard: Guess a number between 1-150 with 2 attempts.
- Provides feedback on the number of attempts used and the number of remaining attempts.
- Input validation ensures the user enters only valid numbers.

## How It Works
1. Select the difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
2. Guess the number by typing it into the input box.
3. The game will give you feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. The game ends either when you guess the correct number or exceed the maximum number of attempts.
